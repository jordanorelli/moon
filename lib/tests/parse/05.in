# this was original a variable test case, but I'm changing it to be a bare
# string / quoted string test.  The variable test will come after; variables
# are broken right now.

quoted_string: "this is a quoted string"
bare_string: this is a bare string
name with space: that name has spaces in it, and you know what? that's ok!
